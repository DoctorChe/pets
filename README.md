Pets is a website where people can publish lost pets
and pets available for adoption.

Users can create an account with a username and password,
or they can use their Twitter and Facebook to login. You can also extend it to use other providers as it's backed by [python-social-auth](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-social-auth).

Images uploaded by users are cropped with [easy-thumbnails](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easy-thumbnails) to improve the site performance.

**It's still a work in progress**

## Installing

### Requirements

* [Python](https://python.org) 3.4 or newer
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) running with a _database_, _username_ and _password_ to be used with Pets.


### Fork and clone the repository

First fork the project using GitHub, than clone it locally:

```console
git clone https://github.com/<username>/pets.git
cd pets
```

### Configure your instance

The project configuration uses [python-decouple](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-decouple/) to dynamically read environment variables and `.env` files.

If you want, you can get started by copying `contrib/sample-env` as `.env`:

```console
cp contrib/sample-env pets/.env
```

Then you have to set following variables:

#### Basic Django settings

* **`SECRET_KEY`**: [Django's secret key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY)
* **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`** (e.g. `127.0.0.1, .localhost`) [Django's allowed hosts](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts)
* **`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`**: In order to make development and deploy to production simpler there's two settings module; `pets.settings.dev` for development and `pets.settings.prod` for production.

#### Database

* **`DB_NAME`**, **`DB_USERNAME`**, **`DB_PASSWORD`**, **`DB_IP`**, **`DB_PORT`**: Credentials to access Pets's database.
* **`DB_ENGINE`**: Django databse backend to connect to Pets's database (e.g. `django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2`)
* **`DB_CONN_MAX_AGE`**: (e.g. `0`) [Django's database `CONN_MAX_AGE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#std:setting-CONN_MAX_AGE`)

#### Mail server for sending e-mails

* **`EMAIL_PORT`**, **`EMAIL_HOST`**, **`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`** and **`EMAIL_HOST_USER`**: SMTP credentials to a mail server.

#### OAuth

If you want to login via social media, you will have to create apps as a developer [at Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com) and/or [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com). Once you're done, set the _app secret_ and _app key_ for each of them:

* `SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_KEY`
* `SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET`
* `SOCIAL_AUTH_TWITTER_KEY`
* `SOCIAL_AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET`

### Other dependencies

#### Install Pillow dependencies

As Pets uses [Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow), some extra packages are needed. In a Debian based Linux this should do the job:

```console
sudo apt-get install python-dev python3.x-dev libjpeg8-dev 
```

#### Install PhantomJS

To install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) in a Debian based Linux you migh follow [Julio Napur√≠'s tutorial](https://gist.github.com/julionc/7476620).

In a Mac with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), this does the trick:

```console
brew install phantomjs
```

### Install Python packages

```console
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

### Test

Execute all tests, it will take some minutes.

```console
cd pets
python manage.py test
```
